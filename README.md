Artificial Intelligence Tpe 2016

GitHub Repository for all our code requiring the use of neural networks. 

##m√©decine
Two similar folders "cancer_1" and "cancer_2" containing neural networks to aiming at evaluating breast cancer nature - benign/malignant.

###/resources
resource folder containing the datasets and their corresponding description as provided by the UCI Machine Learning repository at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Original)

The data used was accordingly split into "train_data.txt" and "validation_data.txt".

###/src
source folder containing the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) code written in python 3.5.

Note: all source files require the installation of Keras: https://keras.io ; TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org ; Theano: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/ 

Unix based system recommended for possible compatibility issues

###accuracies
current accuracies after training on the validation sets: 

cancer_1: ~94%
  
cancer_2: 92~96%
